    **Relationship Handling:**
    It uses a nested BookSerializer to dynamically serialize all related
    Book objects for an Author. The `many=True` argument is crucial as
    an Author can have multiple Books (a one-to-many relationship).
    The field name 'books' matches the `related_name` defined in the
    ForeignKey field in the Book model (`author = models.ForeignKey(..., related_name='books')`).
    This allows the serializer to access the reverse relationship.
